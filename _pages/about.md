Hi and welcome! My name is Feifei, and I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate at UC Santa Barbara working with Dr. Vamsi Ganti. I got my Bachelor's of Science in geology at the University of Texas at Austin where I studied aeolian dune deposits at White Sands National Park. In my graduate research, I study the geometry of braided rivers and their deposits using a combination of experiments and remote sensing. In my free time, I like playing horror video games and piano.
